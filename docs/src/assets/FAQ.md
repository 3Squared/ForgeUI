## Why has typescript stopped working for computed properties?
If this happens then just add return types to all computed properties

## What is Forge UI PWA?
ForgeUI PWA is a standalone version of the style-guide based on the Web variant. <br/>
It's a **Progressive Web App** meaning it can be used offline, and accessed with a native-like feel from any device (desktop, mobile).<br/>
Once the internet connection is restored, the app will automatically update itself if need be.
